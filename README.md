A simple gem to help you perform data migrations in your Rails app. The premise
is simple: bundle the migration code along with a verification test to assert
that the migration achieves the desired effect. If either the migration or the
verification step fails, the entire migration is rolled back.

> Can't I just test my rake task or migration script?

Great question. Yes, you should test your migration code (including the Data
Customs migrations). The problem is that **production data is always different
from your test data**, and **in unexpected ways**. This means that even if your
tests pass, the migration might still fail when run in production.

Data Customs provides a safety net by ensuring that if the migration doesn't do
what you expect it to do, the changes are rolled back. This way, you can
investigate the issue and fix it without leaving your data in a half-migrated
(or bad!) state.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add data_customs
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by
executing:

```bash
gem install data_customs
```

## Usage

### Generating a data migration

You can create a new data migration by running:

```bash
rails generate data_migration MigrationName
```

That will create a file at `db/data_migrations/migration_name.rb`.

### Writing a data migration

After generating a migration, implement the `up` method with the code that
performs the data migration, and the `verify!` method with the code that
asserts that the migration was successful.

```ruby
class AddDefaultUsername < DataCustoms::Migration
  def up
    User.where.missing(:username).update_all(username: "guest")
  end

  def verify!
    if User.exists?(username: nil)
      raise "Some users still have no usernames!"
    end
  end
end

AddDefaultUsername.run # runs the migration and rolls back if necessary
```

Use any exception to indicate failure in the `verify!` method.

> [!TIP]
> Include modules like `RSpec::Matchers` or `Minitest::Assertions` in your
> migration class to use your favorite assertions and matchers inside `verify!`.

If you need to pass arguments to the data migration, you can use an initializer
and `run` will forward any arguments to it.

```ruby
class AddDefaultUsername < DataCustoms::Migration
  def initialize(default_username "guest")
    @default_username = default_username
  end

  def up
    User.where.missing(:username).update_all(username: @default_username)
  end

  def verify!
    if User.exists?(username: nil)
      raise "Some users still have no usernames!"
    end
  end
end

AddDefaultUsername.run("anonymous")
```

#### Dealing with large datasets

The migration code runs inside a transaction, so be careful when dealing with
large datasets, as [it will block the database][blocking] for the duration of
the transaction.

Data Customs provides a few helpers to make working in batches easier and
automatically throttles the migration to avoid overwhelming the database.

```ruby
class AddDefaultUsername < DataCustoms::Migration
  def up
    batch(User.where.missing(:username)) do |relation|
      relation.update_all(username: "guest")
    end
  end
end
```

Or, if you need access to each individual record:

```ruby
class AddDefaultUsername < DataCustoms::Migration
  def up
    find_each(User.where.missing(:username)) do |record|
      # do something with record
    end
  end
end
```

For both methods, you can configure the batch size and the pause between batches:

```ruby
class LongMigration < DataCustoms::Migration
  def up
    batch(records, batch_size: 500, throttle_seconds: 0.1) do |relation|
      # ...
    end

    find_each(records, batch_size: 500, throttle_seconds: 0.1) do |record|
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

### Running a data migration in the command line

These migrations don't run automatically. You need to invoke them manually.
Since they might take some time, you can choose the best time to run them.

If you want to run a data migration from the command line, you can use the
`data_customs:run` task. It accepts the migration class name (either in
PascalCase or snake_case) as an argument:

```bash
rails data_customs:run NAME=AddDefaultUsername
# or
rake data_customs:run NAME=add_default_username
```

If you need to pass arguments to the migration, you can do so by passing them as
additional arguments to the task:

```bash
rails data_customs:run NAME=AddDefaultUsername ARGS="anonymous"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.
